# Thought on hackerRank
I found the problems to be more or less beginner level despite what the difficulty says, non the less great practice for some one whose just getting into C, but if you have prior experience wouldnt really be challenging enough.
# Goal
This repo serves purpose of storing/sharing my C HackerRank solutions with others in hope to help people learn.
# More Solutions Shall Be Added In My Free Time ðŸ˜€

# quick side note :

excluded multiple solutions to questions, hence i believed they are so unbelievably trivial anyone who want to pursue any level of C knowledge should be able to come up with a solution.
